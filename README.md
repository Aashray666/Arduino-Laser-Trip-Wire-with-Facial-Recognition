### Laser Tripwire System with Face Recognition

This project integrates an Arduino Uno-based laser tripwire system with face recognition using Python and OpenCV. The laser tripwire detects intrusions and triggers alarms using a speaker and LEDs, while the face recognition feature allows the system to identify known faces and stop the alarm when a recognized individual is detected.

#### Features:
- **Laser Detection**: Detects when the laser beam is interrupted, triggering an alarm.
- **Face Recognition**: Captures images when the laser is tripped and checks if the face is known.
- **Alarm System**: Activates a buzzer and LEDs when an intrusion is detected.
- **Python Integration**: Uses `pySerial` for communication between the Arduino and the face recognition system.
  
#### Requirements:
- Arduino IDE for uploading the laser tripwire code to the Arduino Uno.
- Python with libraries like `face_recognition`, `OpenCV`, and `pySerial` for face recognition and serial communication.

#### How to Use:
1. Set up the hardware and upload the Arduino code.
2. Run the Python script to enable face recognition and serial communication.
3. When the laser is tripped, the system will capture images, attempt face recognition, and either stop or continue the alarm based on the result.

This project is ideal for home security or educational demonstrations on Arduino and face recognition technology.
